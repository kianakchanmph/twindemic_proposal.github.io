# Title: Twindemic: Examining the relationship between COVID-19 and Influenza in NYC

### Names: Teshawna Badu (tb2910), Kiana Chan (kkc2146), Judy Fordjuoh (jf3354), Rachelle Juan (raj2152), Kelvin Tamakloe (kdt2119)

## Motivation:
This winter will be the first real flu season we have had since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many experts are concerned that lower immunity to flu, decreased social distancing and mask wearing, and return to school and work will cause a “twindemic” where there is a simultaneous outbreak of flu and COVID-19. This leads us to ask the following questions
* Option: What is the relationship between COVID and Flu Vaccination Uptake by Zipcode and Sociodemographic Factors in NYC?
* Option:  What is the difference in COVID and Flu vaccine uptake in NYC, according to  associated sociodemographic factors?
* Option: What are the patterns observed for COVID and Flu vaccine uptake in New York by zip code?
* Option: Difference in COVID and Flu vaccine uptake in NYC and associated sociodemographic factors.

## Intended Final Products:

## Planned Analysis, Visualizations, Coding Challenges: 


## Planned Analysis: 
* analysis of demographic variables (race, education, SES, age) on COVID and flu vaccination uptake, regression analysis (regress flu vaccine on COVID vaccine — predict chance of getting flu vaccine if they got COVID vaccines; regress flu ED visits on COVID and flu vaccine), 

## Visualizations: 
* map of flu vaccine locations, spatial heatmap of ED visits/admissions for flu and covid, vaccine rates by different demographic groups (bar chart), line graph of flu admissions by month of year (we predict to see seasonality)

## Coding challenges: 
* understanding collaboration in Github, running statistical analyses in R (we’re more experienced using SAS/STATA)


# Timeline

## November 13
